# uni_project_ARIMA
works on specification for ARIMA model

This preject aims to propose a set of possible ARIMA(p, d, q) models for the time series of Antarctica land ice mass. 
The data set contains yearly changes in Antarctica land ice mass from 2002 to 2020. 
This project is going to use model specification tools such as ACF-PACF, EACF, BIC table to find possible choices of (p, d, q). 
Transformation techniques, such as Box-Cox transformation and differencing, will be used when applicable.
